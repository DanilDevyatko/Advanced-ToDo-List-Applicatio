# Advanced ToDo List Application

## Description

This is an advanced ToDo List application built using **React**, **Redux**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. The app allows users to manage tasks efficiently with features such as filtering active/completed tasks, task status toggling, and task removal. All task data is stored in the browser's **localStorage** to preserve user information between sessions.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as completed or active.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove individual tasks from the list.
- **Filter Tasks**: Filter tasks based on their status (All, Active, Completed).
- **localStorage**: Task data is saved locally, allowing users to revisit their tasks even after closing the browser.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works on all device sizes.
